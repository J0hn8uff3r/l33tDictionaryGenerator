# l33tDictionaryGenerator

The main purpose of this tiny script is to generate a fast l33t dictionary to use it with tools like Hashcat, to perform dictionary attacks.

A common practice choosing easy to remember passwords inside companies is to change the company name letters to leet speak like:

google > go0gl€, g[]*6lë, 6()9G!E

nvidia > nV1d|a, ]\[Vid¦/\, NVI[>14

It can be combined with some masks in hashcat adding characters before and after to attack more complex password hashes.
